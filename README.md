# Coding School 2022 by Epsilon Net
The repository contains all the exercises by the sessions of the coding school from Epsilon Net. The structure of the repository is based on a single Visual Studio Solution, and each session added as a different project of the solution. This can give you the flexibility to build each project on each own.
